              Leaving there and proceeding for three days toward the east, you
              reach Diomira, a city with sixty silver domes, bronze statues of
              all the gods, streets paved with lead, a crystal theater, a golden
              cock that crows each morning on a tower. <br /><br />
              All these beauties will already be familiar to the visitor, who
              has seen them also in other cities. <br /><br />But the special
              quality of this city for the man who arrives there on a September
              evening, when the days are growing shorter and the multicolored
              lamps are lighted all at once at the doors of the food stalls and
              from a terrace a woman’s voice cries ooh!, is that he feels envy
              toward those who now believe they have once before lived an
              evening identical to this and who think they were happy, that
              time.

            <p>
              There are two ways of describing the city of Dorothea: you can say
              that four aluminum towers rise from its walls flanking seven gates
              with spring-operated drawbridges that span the moat whose water
              feeds four green canals which cross the city, dividing it into
              nine quarters, each with three hundred houses and seven hundred
              chimneys. And bearing in mind that the nubile girls of each
              quarter marry youths of other quarters and their parents exchange
              the goods that each family holds in monopoly – bergamot, sturgeon
              roe, astrolabes, amethysts – you can then work from these facts
              until you learn everything you wish about the city in the past,
              present, and future. <br /><br />Or else you can say, like the
              camel driver who took me there: “I arrived here in my first youth,
              one morning, many people were hurrying along the streets toward
              the market, the women had fine teeth and looked you straight in
              the eye, three soldiers on a platform played the trumpet, and all
              around wheels turned and colored banners fluttered in the wind.
              Before then I had known only the desert and the caravan routes. In
              the years that followed, my eyes returned to contemplate the
              desert expanses and the caravan routes; but now I know this path
              is only one of the many that opened before me on that morning in
              Dorothea.”

            <p>
              At the end of three days, moving southward, you come upon
              Anastasia, a city with concentric canals watering it and kites
              flying over it. I should now list the wares that can profitably be
              bought here: agate, onyx, chrysoprase, and other varieties of
              chalcedony; I should praise the flesh of the golden pheasant
              cooked here over fires of seasoned cherry wood and sprinkled with
              much sweet marjoram; and tell of the women I have seen bathing in
              the pool of a garden and who sometimes – it is said – invite the
              stranger to disrobe with them and chase them in the water.
              <br /><br />But with all this, I would not be telling you the
              city’s true essence; for while the description of Anastasia
              awakens desires one at a time only to force you to stifle them,
              when you are in the heart of Anastasia one morning your desires
              waken all at once and surround you. The city appears to you as a
              whole where no desire is lost and of which you are a part, and
              since it enjoys everything you do not enjoy, you can do nothing
              but inhabit this desire and be content. Such is the power,
              sometimes called malignant, sometimes benign, that Anastasia, the
              treacherous city, possesses; if for eight hours a day you work as
              a cutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labor which gives form
              to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are
              enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave.

            <p>
              Beyond six rivers and three mountain ranges rises Zora, a city
              that no one, having seen it, can forget. But not because, like
              other memorable cities, it leaves an unusual image in your
              recollections. Zora has the quality of remaining in your memory
              point by point, in its succession of streets, of houses along the
              streets, and of doors and windows in the houses, though nothing in
              them possesses a special beauty or rarity. <br /><br />Zora’s
              secret lies in the way your gaze runs over patterns following one
              another as in a musical score where not a note can be altered or
              displaced. <br /><br />The man who knows by heart how Zora is
              made, if he is unable to sleep at night, can imagine he is walking
              along the streets and he remembers the order by which the copper
              clock follows the barber’s striped awning, then the fountain with
              the nine jets, the astronomer’s glass tower, the melon vendor’s
              kiosk, the statue of the hermit and the lion, the Turkish bath,
              the café at the corner, the alley that leads to the harbor.<br /><br />
              This city which cannot be expunged from the mind is like an
              armature, a honeycomb in whose cells each of us can place the
              things he wants to remember: names of famous men, virtues,
              numbers, vegetable and mineral classifications, dates of battles,
              constellations, parts of speech. Between each idea and each point
              of the itinerary an affinity or a contrast can be established,
              serving as an immediate aid to memory. So the world’s most learned
              men are those who have memorized Zora. But in vain I set out to
              visit the city: forced to remain motionless and always the same,
              in order to be more easily remembered, Zora has languished,
              disintegrated, disappeared. The earth has forgotten her.

              Travelers return from the city of Zirma with distinct memories: a
              blind black man shouting in the crowd, a lunatic teetering on a
              skyscraper’s cornice, a girl walking with a puma on a leash.
              Actually many of the blind men who tap their canes on Zirma’s
              cobblestones are black; in every skyscraper there is someone going
              mad; all lunatics spend hours on cornices; there is no puma that
              some girl does not raise, as a whim.<br /><br />
              The city is redundant: it repeats itself so that something will
              stick in the mind. I too am returning from Zirma: my memory
              includes dirigibles flying in all directions, at window level;
              streets of shops where tattoos are drawn on sailors’ skin;
              underground trains crammed with obese women suffering from the
              humidity. My traveling companions, on the other hand, swear they
              saw only one dirigible hovering among the city’s spires, only one
              tattoo artist arranging needles and inks and pierced patterns on
              his bench, only one fat woman fanning herself on a train’s
              platform. Memory is redundant: it repeats signs so that the city
              can begin to exist.

              When a man rides a long time through wild regions he feels the
              desire for a city. <br /><br />
              Finally he comes to Isidora, a city where the buildings have
              spiral staircases encrusted with spiral seashells, where perfect
              telescopes and violins are made, where the foreigner hesitating
              between two women always encounters a third, where cockfights
              degenerate into bloody brawls among the bettors. He was thinking
              of all these things when he desired a city. <br /><br />
              Isidora, therefore, is the city of his dreams: with one
              difference. The dreamed-of city contained him as a young man; he
              arrives at Isidora in his old age. In the square there is the wall
              where the old men sit and watch the young go by; he is seated in a
              row with them. Desires are already memories.

              Cities and Memory<br />
              III
            </h2>
            <p>
              In vain, great-hearted Kublai, shall I attempt to describe Zaira,
              city of high bastions. I could tell you how many steps make up the
              streets rising like stairways, and the degree of the arcades’
              curves, and what kind of zinc scales cover the roofs; but I
              already know this would be the same as telling you nothing.
              <br /><br />The city does not consist of this, but of
              relationships between the measurements of its space and the events
              of its past: the height of a lamppost and the distance from the
              ground of a hanged usurper’s swaying feet; the line strung from
              the lamppost to the railing opposite and the festoons that
              decorate the course of the queen’s nuptial procession; the height
              of that railing and the leap of the adulterer who climbed over it
              at dawn; the tilt of a guttering and a cat’s progress along it as
              he slips into the same window; the firing range of a gunboat which
              has suddenly appeared beyond the cape and the bomb that destroys
              the guttering; the rips in the fish net and the three old men
              seated on the dock mending nets and telling each other for the
              hundredth time the story of the gunboat of the usurper, who some
              say was the queen’s illegitimate son, abandoned in his swaddling
              clothes there on the dock. <br /><br />
              As this wave from memories flows in, the city soaks it up like a
              sponge and expands. A description of Zaira as it is today should
              contain all Zaira’s past. The city, however, does not tell its
              past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the
              corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters
              of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the
              flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations,
              scrolls.

            <h2>Cities and Signs<br />I</h2>
            <p>
              You walk for days among trees and among stones. Rarely does the
              eye light on a thing, and then only when it has recognized that
              thing as the sign of another thing: a print in the sand indicates
              the tiger’s passage; a marsh announces a vein of water; the
              hibiscus flower, the end of winter. All the rest is silent and
              interchangeable; trees and stones are only what they are.
              <br /><br />Finally the journey leads to the city of Tamara. You
              penetrate it along streets thick with signboards jutting from the
              walls. The eye does not see things but images of things that mean
              other things: pincers point out the tooth-drawer’s house; a
              tankard, the tavern; halberds, the barracks; scales, the grocer’s.
              Statues and shields depict lions, dolphins, towers, stars: a sign
              that something – who knows what? – has as its sign a lion or a
              dolphin or a tower or a star. Other signals warn of what is
              forbidden in a given place (to enter the alley with wagons, to
              urinate behind the kiosk, to fish with your pole from the bridge)
              and what is allowed (watering zebras, playing bowls, burning
              relatives’ corpses). From the doors of the temples the gods’
              statues are seen, each portrayed with his attributes – the
              cornucopia, the hourglass, the medusa – so that the worshiper can
              recognize them and address his prayers correctly. <br /><br />If a
              building has no signboard or figure, its very form and the
              position it occupies in the city’s order suffice to indicate its
              function: the palace, the prison, the mint, the Pythagorean
              school, the brothel. The wares, too, which the vendors display on
              their stalls are valuable not in themselves but as signs of other
              things: the embroidered headband stands for elegance; the gilded
              palanquin, power; the volumes of Averroes, learning; the ankle
              bracelet, voluptuousness. <br /><br />Your gaze scans the streets
              as if they were written pages: the city says everything you must
              think, makes you repeat her discourse, and while you believe you
              are visiting Tamara you are only recording the names with which
              she defines herself and all her parts. However the city may really
              be, beneath this thick coating of signs, whatever it may contain
              or conceal, you leave Tamara without having discovered it.
              Outside, the land stretches, empty, to the horizon; the sky opens,
              with speeding clouds. In the shape that chance and wind give the
              clouds, you are already intent on recognizing figures: a sailing
              ship, a hand, an elephant. . . .

              Despina can be reached in two ways: by ship or by camel. The city
              displays one face to the traveler arriving overland and a
              different one to him who arrives by sea. <br /><br />
              When the camel driver sees, at the horizon of the tableland, the
              pinnacles of the skyscrapers come into view, the radar antennae,
              the white and red wind-socks flapping, the chimneys belching
              smoke, he thinks of a ship; he knows it is a city, but he thinks
              of it as a vessel that will take him away from the desert, a
              windjammer about to cast off, with the breeze already swelling the
              sails, not yet unfurled, or a steamboat with its boiler vibrating
              in the iron keel; and he thinks of all the ports, the foreign
              merchandise the cranes unload on the docks, the taverns where
              crews of different flags break bottles over one another’s heads,
              the lighted, ground-floor windows, each with a woman combing her
              hair. <br /><br />
              In the coastline’s haze, the sailor discerns the form of a camel’s
              withers, an embroidered saddle with glittering fringe between two
              spotted humps, advancing and swaying; he knows it is a city, but
              he thinks of it as a camel from whose pack hang wineskins and bags
              of candied fruit, date wine, tobacco leaves, and already he sees
              himself at the head of a long caravan taking him away from the
              desert of the sea, toward oases of fresh water in the palm trees’
              jagged shade, toward palaces of thick, whitewashed walls, tiled
              courts where girls are dancing barefoot, moving their arms,
              half-hidden by their veils, and half-revealed. <br /><br />
              Each city receives its form from the desert it opposes; and so the
              camel driver and the sailor see Despina, a border city between two
              deserts.

            <p>
              Isaura, city of the thousand wells, is said to rise over a deep,
              subterranean lake. On all sides, wherever the inhabitants dig long
              vertical holes in the ground, they succeed in drawing up water, as
              far as the city extends, and no farther. Its green border repeats
              the dark outline of the buried lake; an invisible landscape
              conditions the visible one; everything that moves in the sunlight
              is driven by the lapping wave enclosed beneath the rock’s
              calcareous sky. <br /><br />
              Consequently two forms of religion exist in Isaura. <br />
              The city’s gods, according to some people, live in the depths, in
              the black lake that feeds the underground streams. According to
              others, the gods live in the buckets that rise, suspended from a
              cable, as they appear over the edge of the wells, in the revolving
              pulleys, in the windlasses of the norias, in the pump handles, in
              the blades of the windmills that draw the water up from the
              drillings, in the trestles that support the twisting probes, in
              the reservoirs perched on stilts over the roofs, in the slender
              arches of the aqueducts, in all the columns of water, the vertical
              pipes, the plungers, the drains, all the way up to the
              weathercocks that surmount the airy scaffoldings of Isaura, a city
              that moves entirely upward.
